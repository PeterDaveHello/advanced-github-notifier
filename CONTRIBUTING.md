## Translations
The strings for this extension can be translated on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/freaktechnik/advanced-github-notifier/).

## Issues etc.
Feel free to file issues and describe your problem. I'll likely try to solve it
when I find time for it. Or maybe someone else will step up and fix it :)

## Writing code
In theory all you should have to do is run `npm ci` (after installing npm and node)
and you should be able to launch a Firefox instance with the extension in debugging
mode with live reloading with `npm start`.

There are some linters and tests. `npm test` runs all linters and tests.
